# BOLD Biodiversity Analysis

This repository contains R scripts and workflows for retrieving, cleaning, and analyzing DNA barcode data from the [BOLD Systems API](https://www.boldsystems.org/).  
The pipeline is designed for biodiversity research in Ecuador, Costa Rica, and Panama, with automated routines for downloading, merging, summarizing, and visualizing barcode datasets across multiple localities.

- ðŸ“¥ Download and store barcode datasets by process IDs  
- ðŸ’¾ Use local `.rds` files for faster workflows  
- ðŸ§¹ Clean and merge datasets with standardized locality metadata  
- ðŸ“Š Generate concise summaries and export results as `.csv`  
- ðŸŽ¨ Visualization-ready datasets for downstream analyses (e.g., ggplot2, vegan)
